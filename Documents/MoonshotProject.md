# MOONSHOT PROJECT : Randomizer simulator (OOTR[^0])
***
## Overview 
Video games are a great part of entertainment for people nowadays. Especially Randomizer Games [^1] are getting more and more popular. Now a competitive scene where people can show their skills on different games is growing with it.

## WHAT problem is your moonshot project solving

First of all, I want to say that playing Randomizer require 3 major skills: 
- Execution: To be simple, it's your skills/consistency with movement. You can practice/training it by playing multiple time the game. For some game, some tools exist to help with that.
- Logic: When you played Randomizer, there is always a logic that ensures that every "item" in your game can be obtainable to finish it.
- Routing: It's the order to check that you are doing. for example : let's says there are area A , B , C in your game. Player 1 will go to A,B,C in this order but Player 2 will go to B,C,A because he found something that make area B more interesting. 

Training randomizer game can be pretty time consuming because some seed can take up 2H to 5h depending on your skill levels and the seed [^2] itself. There is no other way to train Logic and Routing skills without playing a seed directly and there are no tools available right now.
In consequence, I want to create a simulator (for the game Zelda Ocarina of Time) that will allow players to train their Logic and Routing skills without having to spend hours and hours on gameplay.

## WHY do you think this problem is worth solving

This problem is worth solving because I think Randomizer (in this globality) have a great potential in the future of entertainment, so making it more accessible for people could make a good "publicity" for randomizer game in general. It will also increase the number of "high skill" players and getting more attention in general. In addition, this problem is not being seen only on one game, but in most of the game so I could extend this project to most of the popular games.


## HOW are you going to solve that problem (brief technical explanation on the technologies used)
 
 I was thinking of using an application or a website where users can click on the links to do check on certain areas. When they found some items, there will be a tracker [^3] (to keep an eye on what item you've got) and there could travel to another area with other links. It also gives the player a simulation time (as if he was playing) when he finishes the seed.

 [^1]: Every major/non important item, that the player can get, in the game is shuffled between their location, meaning you can find a powerful weapon for example in a small chest that was accessible in the beginning.

 [^2]: A seed is a number given representing the games where all the items are randomized (every seed is different from the previous one).

 [^3]: Going through and finishing an OoTR seed can be quite a challenge. Trackers help keep track of which items you have found in your playthrough so far.
